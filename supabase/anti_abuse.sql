-- Tyverix anti-abuse: one free trial per device, and a device cap per
-- account, so people can't farm endless 1-day trials with throwaway emails on
-- the same PC, or hand one paid login around to an unlimited number of
-- installs. "Device" = this Windows installation's stable MachineGuid (read
-- by the app's `get_device_id` command).
--
-- Honest limitation: a determined abuser could still reinstall Windows or
-- spoof the ID — this raises the bar meaningfully, it is not unbeatable.
--
-- Run this once in the Supabase SQL editor, alongside schema.sql and support.sql.
